Humanity has envisioned many tasks which could be carried out by robots including transportation, health care, save and rescue and many more. Robots of current world can efficiently operate only in very limited conditions. To solve problems of the future we need fast and reliable algorithms for our robots. Big question in field of mobile robotics is how to efficiently localize robot and create map as precise as possible. This problem is often referred to as \gls{SLAM} problem.

Good localization is crucial part of any good navigation software. Generated map plays important role in path planning and  multi-robot coordination. SLAM algorithm should relay mostly on robots internal sensors like, e.g., sonars, cameras, wheel encoders. Using \gls{GPS} is only possible in outdoor environment. Precision of this localization is very often not good enough to successfully navigate robot.

In last decade many high quality \gls{SLAM} algorithms where presented. Solution to full problem of map building and robot positioning is usually done by combining state-of-the-art approaches in related fields of study. This work combines \gls{NDT} map building process and scan registration with well developed research branch of graph-based \gls{SLAM} optimizing engines. To achieve this combination this work presents extended implementation of \gls{NDT} mapping process and new way of robust scan-matching on \gls{NDT} map. Implementation is done in \gls{ROS} to make it easy to use.

This text is structured as follows: Key algorithms and concepts used in whole problem solution are explained in Section 1. In Section 2, is described process of scan matching, graph building, optimization and NDT mapping. Section 3 presents implementation details of this algorithm. Section 4 discuss mapping results and comparison to well known implementations in ROS.
