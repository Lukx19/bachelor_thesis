\chapter{Future works}

This work has focused on 2D graph based \gls{SLAM} on \gls{NDT} maps. In the future work it should be extended into 3D space. Performance of \gls{NDT} mapping and registration depends on amount of data which can be inputted into cell creation. Therefore, couple layers from 3D laser point cloud merged together could represent better 2D information for registration.

Different methods for loop closure registration should tested in the future. One of the option is creation of feature descriptor and utilizing well know registration algorithms used in computer vision. This work may be also expanded by fusion of 3D vision color information with 3D point cloud. This would add more information to individual cells. It could increase precision and convergence time in 3D case.  

This work is possible to extend on the side of pose graph as well. The graph can be improved by fusion of similar nodes. This would allow using this algorithm over long period without increase on memory usage. Another improvement could implement multi-layer graph representation for mapping purposes of multiple floors.
