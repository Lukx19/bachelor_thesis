\def\Abstract{%
Recent advances in Normal distributions transform occupancy map (NDT-OM) representation has proven to be a viable option for mapping static and dynamic environment. Scan registration methods using NDT maps offer a fast and reliable way of registering two laser scans.  In this work, we combine 2D NDT mapping and scan matching with the graph-based representation of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) optimization approach. This novel approach to full SLAM problem solution uses NDT mini-maps for partial map storage inside of pose graph's nodes. It also includes fast incremental scan matcher for odometry estimation. The scan matcher makes it possible to create larger mini-maps which offer better loop closure validation. This work also presents a novel robust distribution to distribution (D2D)-NDT scan matching. It is used for loop closure registration and validation of correct matches. The implementation can operate as an online algorithm inside of Robot Operating System (ROS) framework. Algorithm was tested on MIT Stata Center datasets.
